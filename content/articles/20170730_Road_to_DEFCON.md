# The Road to DEFCON

_An assortment of helpful hints, tips, need-to-knows and things to remember whenever going to Hacker Cons in the United States, and certain other countries too. Initially written for those going to DEFCON 2017 and may concentrate mainly on Las Vegas NV in consequence, additional info about/for other cons will be added as time calls for it. Produce of more than one Hacker. :-)_

## Know Before You Go <a name="rtd-05"/>

A list of things that you'll almost certainly need to have in hand before you set off for the airport...

### Documentation (And I don't just mean README.TXT!) <a name="rtd-061"/>

* ESTA: *Required* to even board a flight to the U.S. Applications via [US CBP ESTA Programme](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov) (Fee payable)
* Passport: If you havn't got a valid one in hand at least a month before you go, forget it! Even the "_expedited_" application process might not be quick enough.
* ID: Not just a passport (Which is best left in the hotel safe whilst you're staying) but something you can use for ID checks on the street & identification/age verification in liquor stores and casinos. A UK/European photocard driving license is ideal for this as a rule, and will normally be accepted for proving who and how old you are.
* **Fully Comprehensive** Travel Insurance: Importance of this can't be emphesised enough. Even if ObamaCare wasn't in jepordy from the current administration (Mid 2017) it might not be available to foreign tourists, and valid insurance cover may be a legal requirement to enter the United States. If nothing else, cover means if you pass out from too much fun and wake up in the ER you won't be in indentured servitude for the rest of your days!
* Maps: Vegas city is in two main sections about two miles apart, so helps to know what's where and the routes between them. Although online maps can be great for this, nothing beats a paper map if your phone battery runs out or data is costing wayyy too much!

### Cash (And ATM Machines) <a name="rtd-062"/>

* Spending money: As a general rule it's probably best to allow about $100/day IF you're good at doing things on the cheap. For average travellers, a budget of $150-200/day might be a safer bet.
* If going to gaming cities or Native Reservations and planning to hit the casinos (Who doesn't?) multiply those figures by at least 10-25 or more, depending on what sort of gambler you are. Always [Gamble Aware](https://www.gambleaware.co.uk) and *make sure* that you leave your credit cards in the hotel safe before you enter the casino!!!
* Pre-paid currency cards: These are quicker and easier than travellers cheques, much safer than cash, work in ATMs, & can be reloaded/topped-up online whilst travelling. [Caxton FX](https://www.caxtonfx.com) & [FairFX](https://www.fairfx.com) are the two main UK ones, and others are also available.
* Note that Contactless isn't common in the U.S. yet, but European visitors with Chip+PIN cards now have to use this process rather than signing for transactions in most places.
* Most "high-street" banks have 24h ATM lobbies which are available to customers of all banks. Swipe card to gain entry outside of hours (Hacker Con in town? Better use a Clubcard! ;-) and the usual vigilance for suspect devices applies.
* Drive-up ATM banks may be found in various places too. These can be used on foot if you wish, but to avoid looking a right plonker remember that American cars have the drivers window on the _LEFT_! ;-)
* Bank ATMs will often ask which account you want to withdraw from, normally from a choice of "_Deposit_" and "_Checking_" accounts. As a general rule the "_Deposit_" option should be chosen for UK cards, but check with your bank before travel.
* Above note about account types doesn't appear to apply to pre-paid currency cards, which seem to be set-up debit-only so they may not offer that option. It's worth noting that Caxton FX don't charge fees for ATM withdrawls either (At time of writing) though FairFX tend to offer a slightly better exchange rate.
* Casino ATMs will charge you a fee of about eight dollars a time, so best to find a CVS or mini-mart with an ATM instead if you can.

### PCs, phones, laptops & data storage devices <a name="rtd-063"/>

* Expect these to be dumped in full to US-CBP servers on arrival, and expect a requirement to surrender any keys for crypto'd storage too. Wiped and very clean devices tend to be regarded suspect, so scrub/sterilise them well in advance of travel and let them pick up a good few weeks of reasonable use and browsing history courtesy of friends, family and the kids. :-)
* Alternatively: Take no devices, and buy in the US instead. Keep your receipts (Ask for Global Refund receipts) and you can claim back the taxes upon return to the UK if you wish! :-)  
(Remember: It may be more tax-efficient to pay US state/federal taxes on purchases than the UK ones you might be obliged to pay if you claim back the US taxes. Check the rates and duties carefully, and choose whichever option is more efficient for you. :-)

## Getting Around <a name="rtd-10"/>

Railways aside, the United States has comparable public transportation to the UK and as a general rule this is easy enough to use with a few exceptions here and there.

### Local transportation <a name="rtd-110"/>

* Most cities have plenty of taxis about, and on-demand private hire services (Usually Lyft and Uber) are generally available too. Some places may have carpooling schemes accessible through apps like BlaBlaCar and other services, and these may be preferable to hiring a car outright.
* Certain locations and businesses - Generally hotels, casinos and certain out-of-town concerns - Also provide complimentary shuttle services on request, and these are generally but a phone call away. As is general practice around the US, tips are greatly appreciated. :-)
* Local bus networks are often similar to those in Europe, but beware that certain locations (Orange County CA and New York City) have networks that operate in very odd ways and can be difficult for those not accustomed to them. DieselDragon suggests avoiding OCTA buses like your life depends upon it!
* Those going to DEFCON on a budget; Local bus routes do serve Las Vegas airport, but they call at the bottom of the short-stay multi-storey car park and not the arrivals pickup/dropoff lane like you'd imagine. Airport staff will be able to direct you if necessary, and journey time to the main bus station is about 35 minutes.

### Regional and Intercity air travel <a name="rtd-111"/>

* The United States is well known for it's ready use of intercity air travel, and the quantity of routes and options can simply be staggering in many cases. Although even short-distance flight is regarded routine in the US, this does come with caveats (Check-in times, baggage limitations etc) and other options might be better for tourist purposes.
* If looking for flight options for any given journey, you might be able to save a few bucks by taking an indirect route with changes versus a direct flight. Also consider less popular nearby airports (i.e: Newark NJ instead of JFK) and cheap, remote airports with usable connections to the Greyhound network. (See below)
* When flying into the United States; Try to book early on a route served by a number of operators, then use local/regional options to bridge the last mile. Competition and promos will help to keep the fares low on popular routes, and a flight to Chicago with a Greyhond to Las Vegas will probably work out notably cheaper than flying there direct from the UK.
* Pro-tip: Use a price comparison site like [Kayak](https://www.kayak.com/flights) to find out which airlines and routes are the cheapest, then book direct with that operator. You might save a few bucks by saving them a referral fee from the former.
* Alternative airports for DEFCON: Greyhound takes about 6-8h from either Los Angeles CA or Denver CO, about 12-15h from San Francisco CA (Via Los Angeles) and this is guaranteed to be quicker, easier and cheaper than using a hire car to complete your journey. South West ~~trains~~ Airlines probably run shuttle flights between all of these airports as well, and they are generally cheap enough if booked well in advance.
* Alternative airports for HOPE: Consider Newark NJ, Philadelphia PA, Baltimore MD, Boston MA, Washington DC, Chicago IL and Atlanta GA. Greyhound serve all of these cities with direct buses to New York City, and the first five are also fairly accessible via Amtrak services along the North East Corridor mainline. (Though note important warnings about the railway below!)

### Intercity buses (Coaches) <a name="rtd-112"/>

* Alternative airports for DEFCON: Greyhound takes about 6-8h from either Los Angeles CA or Denver CO, about 12-15h from San Francisco CA (Via Los Angeles) and it's guaranteed to be quicker, easier and cheaper than using a hire car to transfer between them.
* Although Greyhound are a great way to get about between cities, they're not the most punctual option. Allow yourself about 9-12h slack time per 1,000 miles and you should be fine.
* Be aware there's still a social stigma attached to using Greyhound buses, even though they are the best way to see & experience America. That said you're on vacation, so if anyone gives you hassle, tell them where to shove it!!!
* Handy to know: Greyhound are owned/operated by First Group of Scotland, so any serious issues with them could be dealt with by suing their parent company and saving the hassles of a transatlantic lawsuit. Additional advantage would be that entire suit can be progressed under UK Law, rather than the varying laws of each U.S. state which might apply.
* On that same token, CoachUSA are a Stagecoach operation. This should imply that Greyhound will offer the better fares between the two, but this could vary and you should shop around when buying bus tickets.
* In some cities you may find smaller, independant bus operations often referred to as "Chinatown buses". Although these are cheaper than Greyhound for most given journeys the standards of security, baggage safety, general safety and passenger loadings can vary widely on these, and so should be used with caution.

### Railways <a name="rtd-113"/>

* Although the United States _does_ have a passenger railway network - [Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com) - Their service is vastly inferior to that offered by most European railway operators, the passenger experience is vastly different to that found in the UK, and fares tend to be _MUCH_ higher than Greyhound for comparable journeys (Though some good bargains can be had on Advance fares from time to time).
* You may be familiar with European railway networks being passenger railways which also carry freight? Well; The American network is the *freight railway which also carries passengers*, and because of this - And the fact that freight trains (Which outnumber passenger trains by about 80:1) are given right-of-way over passenger trains - Journeys on scAmtrak can incur delays of many hours, and even *days* on worryingly frequent occasions.
* Although the North-East Corridor (The mainstay of Amtraks network) is *supposed* to be exclusively for passenger trains, Amtrak often get "Bulleid" into allowing freight trains to use it with priority over passenger trains all the same. Random stoppages without explanation are commonplace, and in the majority of cases staff will have even less information to hand than passengers.
* Unless you are of a particularly sado-masochistic nature, **AVOID scAmtraks cross-country and long-distance trains like the plague.** Not only are these prone to slow working and severe delays, they are often operated using rolling stock that is in poorly maintained and physically unsound condition, wifi and entertainment is unlikely to be available, and you will almost certainly find yourself making unscheduled stops for very long periods (Up to twelve hours per time, or longer) in passing loops whilst right of way is given to freight trains also using the line.
* Using the North East Corridor and considering forking out **$$$$$** for the Acela Excess? Be advised that between Washington DC and Newark NJ the train is limited to a pitiful 100mph throughout and does the greatest injustice to the Eurostar 373-based power cars used on these trains. The North-East Regional service uses the same route at the same speed, takes just 15 mins longer (More intermediate stops) and is *considerably* cheaper than the Acela Express.
* The Acela Excess *should* offer a fairly nice 150mph tilting experience north of Stamford CT *in theory*, but this is entirely dependant on what other trains the signaller might throw in front of it, and satisfaction is definitely **NOT** guaranteed.
* DieselDragons advice is to avoid scAmtrak wherever reasonably possible for all but the shortest of journeys, and be prepared to have the *worst* experience of the railway you could ever hope for. In some cases they can actually be pretty good, but sadly this is the exception rather than the general rule...And when considering that most scAmtrak trains routinely get overtaken by stationary objects (I'm not kidding) their "service" can generally be bettered using a bicycle for shorter travel times at considerably lower cost.
* On the bright side however: Following any trip on a scAmtrak train for more than 500 miles, you'll never say a bad word against Southern, Northern or First MTR ever again!!! ;-)

## Other stuff you don't want to forget... <a name="rtd-50"/>

* Sun cream, even if you tan well. That sun is powerful, intense, and summer temps tend toward the high 40s and even 50s (Celsius!!!)







* Amtrak: Avoid like the plague. They make even Southern look competent, and are the only rail company whose trains routinely get overtaken by stationary objects. You'd genuinely get there quicker (And more refreshed) using a bicycle.
