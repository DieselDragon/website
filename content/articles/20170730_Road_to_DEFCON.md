## Know Before You Go <a name="rtd-05"/>

A list of things that you'll almost certainly need to have in hand before you set off for the airport...

### Documentation (And I don't just mean README.TXT!)

* ESTA: *Required* to even board a flight to the U.S. Applications via [US CBP ESTA Programme](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov) (Fee payable)
* Passport: If you havn't got a valid one in hand at least a month before you go, forget it! Even the "_expedited_" application process might not be quick enough.
* ID: Not just a passport (Which is best left in the hotel safe whilst you're staying) but something you can use for ID checks on the street & identification/age verification in casinos. A UK/European photocard driving license is ideal for this, and will normally be accepted for proving who and how old you are.
* Fully Comprehensive Travel Insurance: Importance of this can't be emphesised enough. Even if ObamaCare wasn't in jepordy from the current administration it may not be available to foreign tourists, and valid insurance cover may be a legal requirement to enter the United States. If nothing else it means if you pass out from too much fun and wake up in A&E, you won't be in indentured servitude for the rest of your days.
* Maps: Vegas city is in two main sections about two miles apart, so helps to know what's where and the routes between them. Although online maps can be great for this, nothing beats a paper map if your phone battery run out or data is costing too much.

### Cash (And ATM Machines)

* Spending money: As a general rule it's probably best to allow about $100/day IF you're good at doing things on the cheap. For average travellers, a budget of $150-200/day might be a safe bet.
* If going to gaming cities or Native Reservations and planning to hit the casinos (And who doesn't?) multiply those figures by at least 10-25 or more, depending on what sort of gambler you are. [Gamble Aware](https://www.gambleaware.co.uk) and *make sure* that you leave your credit cards in the hotel safe before you enter the casino!!!
* Pre-paid currency cards: These are quicker and easier than travellers cheques, much safer than cash, work in ATMs, & can be reloaded/topped-up online whilst travelling. [CaxtonFX](https://www.caxtonfx.com) & [FairFX](https://www.fairfx.com) are the two main UK ones, and others are also available.
* Note that Contactless isn't common in the U.S. yet, but E.U. visitors with Chip+PIN cards now have to use this process rather than signing for transactions in most places.
* Most "high-street" banks have 24h ATM lobbies which are available to customers of all banks. Swipe card to gain entry outside of hours (Hacker Con in town? Better use a Clubcard! ;-) and the usual vigilance for suspect devices applies.
* Drive-up ATM banks may be found in various places too. These can be used on foot if you wish, but to avoid looking a plonker remember that American cars have the drivers window on the LEFT! ;-)
* Bank ATMs will often ask which account you want to withdraw from, normally from a choice of "Deposit" and "Checking" accounts. As a general rule the "Deposit" option should be chosen for UK cards, but check with your bank before travel.
* Above note about account types doesn't appear to apply to pre-paid currency cards, which seem to be set-up debit-only so they may not offer that option. Worth noting CaxtonFX don't charge fees for ATM withdrawls either (At time of writing) though FairFX tend to offer a slightly better exchange rate.
* Casino ATMs will charge you a fee of about eight dollars a time, so best to find a CVS or mini-mart with an ATM instead if you can.

### PCs, phones, laptops & data storage devices

* Expect these to be dumped in full to US-CBP servers on arrival, and expect a requirement to surrender any keys for crypto'd storage too. Wiped and very clean devices tend to be regarded suspect, so scrub/sterilise them well in advance of travel and let them pick up a good few weeks of reasonable use and browsing history courtesy of friends, family and the kids. :-)
* Alternatively: Take no devices, and buy in the US instead. Keep your receipts (Ask for Global Refund receipts) and you can claim back the taxes upon return to the UK if you wish! :-)  
(Remember: It may be more tax-efficient to pay US state/federal taxes on purchases than the UK ones you might be obliged to pay if you claim back the US taxes. Check the rates and duties carefully, and choose whichever option is more efficient for you. :-)

## Getting Around <a name="rtd-10"/>

Railways aside, the United States has comparable public transportation to the UK and as a general rule this is easy enough to use with a few exceptions here and there.

### Local transportation

* Most cities have plenty of taxis about, and on-demand private hire services (Usually Lyft and Uber) are generally available too. Some places may have carpooling schemes accessible through apps like BlaBlaCar and other services, and these may be preferable to hiring a car outright.
* Certain locations and businesses - Generally hotels, casinos and certain out-of-town concerns - Also provide complimentary shuttle services on request, and these are generally but a phone call away. As is general practice around the US, tips are greatly appreciated. :-)
* Local bus networks are often similar to those in Europe, but beware that certain locations (Orange County CA and New York City) have networks that operate in very odd ways and can be difficult for those not accustomed to them. DieselDragon suggests avoiding OCTA buses like your life depends upon it!



### Intercity buses (Coaches)

* Although Greyhound are a great way to get about between cities, they're not the most punctual option. Allow yourself about 9-12h slack time per 1,000 miles and you should be fine.
* Be aware there's still a social stigma attached to using Greyhound buses, even though they are the best way to see & experience America. That said you're on vacation, so if anyone gives you hassle, tell them where to shove it!!!
* Handy to know: Greyhound are owned/operated by First Group of Scotland, so any serious issues with them could be dealt with by suing their parent company and saving the hassles of a transatlantic lawsuit. Additional advantage would be that entire suit can be progressed under UK Law, rather than the varying laws of each U.S. state which might apply.
* On that same token, CoachUSA are a Stagecoach operation. This should imply that Greyhound will offer the better fares between the two, but this could vary and you should shop around when buying bus tickets.
* In some cities you may find smaller, independant bus operations often referred to as "Chinatown buses". Although these are cheaper than Greyhound for most given journeys the standards of security, baggage safety, general safety and passenger loadings can vary widely on these, and so should be used with caution.

## Other stuff you don't want to forget... <a name="rtd-50"/>

* Sun cream, even if you tan well. That sun is powerful, intense, and summer temps tend toward the high 40s and even 50s (Celsius!!!)






Those on a budget; Local bus routes do serve the airport, but they call at the bottom of the short-stay multi-storey and not the arrivals pickup/dropoff lane like you'd imagine.
* Other airports: Greyhound takes about 6-8h from either Los Baños CA or Denver CO, about 12-15h from San Francisco CA (Via Los Baños) and that's probably easier than driving. South West <s>trains</s> Airlines probably run shuttles between them all as well.
* Amtrak: Avoid like the plague. They make even Southern look competent, and are the only rail company whose trains routinely get overtaken by stationary objects. You'd genuinely get there quicker (And more refreshed) using a bicycle.
